					<p>
					Bethesda Community School, Inc. is a private, non-profit, non-discriminatory school for children, 2 years of age through kindergarten.  The school program is approved by the State Department of Education to operate a non-public educational program for a nursery school and Kindergarten. We are accredited by the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) for fully meeting the standards of quality as outlined in the MSDE Standards for Implementing Quality Early Childhood Programs.  The BCS school year runs from the beginning of September to mid-June.  Our Summer Program runs from mid-June through mid-August, and children not enrolled during the school year are welcome to attend.  Our school is open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, for school and /or child care during the school year, and 8:00 – 5:30 during the summer. We offer a variety of attendance options during the school year and summer.  Children may enroll at 2 years of age, and we accept children on a first come, first serve basis.  We feel that we have a good mixture of children due to this policy and feel that the children benefit and learn from shared experiences with other children from varied backgrounds.
